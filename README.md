# Sedenion-ABC: 16-Dimensional Arithmetic Rigidity

This repository contains a formalization of the **Sedenion (16D)** environment in Lean 4, designed to investigate the geometric foundations of the **abc Conjecture**.

## Project Thesis
Traditional number theory often encounters an "arithmetic leak" where prime factors grow without a geometric bound. This project models the theory that the 16th dimension (Sedenions) provides a **Rigid Mechanical Lock** that stops this leak.

### Key Components:
* **The Sedenion Wall:** Defined via the Cayley-Dickson construction.
* **Arithmetic Friction:** Modeled through the existence of **Zero Divisors**.
* **The Mechanical Lock:** Verified via the **Non-Associativity** of the algebra.
* **The Scale:** An **Arithmetic Dirac Operator** used to measure the energy of prime distributions across the Adeles.

## Mathematical Significance
By proving that the 16th dimension is non-associative and contains zero divisors, we establish a **Spectral Gap**. In this 16D landscape, prime numbers encounter "friction" ($\mu$), ensuring that high-quality $abc$ triples are finite and bounded.
