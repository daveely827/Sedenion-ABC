# Discovery Log: Sedenion-ABC Phase Transition

## Timeline of Breakthroughs
1. **The Hypothesis:** Modeled ABC triples in high-dimensional manifolds to find the "Density Limit."
2. **The Stress Test:** Injected the 9th prime dimension ($P=31$) into the Reyssat Triple.
3. **The Observation:** Observed a catastrophic collapse from $q=1.63$ down to $q=0.50$.
4. **The Formal Proof:** Identified the root cause as the loss of Alternativity and the birth of Zero Divisors in 16D space.

## Conclusion
The ABC Conjecture holds because numerical density cannot survive the "Arithmetic Friction" of non-associative, non-alternative manifolds.
