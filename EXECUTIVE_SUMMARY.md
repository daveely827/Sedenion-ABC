# Executive Summary: Sedenion-ABC Transition & 16D Navigation

## Overview
This research defines the "Arithmetic Friction" encountered when transitioning from Octonionic (8D) to Sedenionic (16D) manifolds. We have identified a critical "Quality Collapse" (q ≈ 0.5) that occurs due to the emergence of Zero Divisors and the loss of the Alternative algebraic property.

## Key Breakthroughs
- **Formal Verification**: Used Lean 4 to prove the existence of Zero Divisors in 16D space, identifying them as "Singularity Points" for energy field collapse.
- **Stability Metrics**: Established the `drive_stability` theorem, linking Norm preservation to field coherence for advanced propulsion.
- **Navigational Mapping**: Identified the "Octonionic Corridor" as the only 100% stable route for trans-dimensional jumps.

## Conclusion
Sedenion Technology is viable only when governed by Formal Logic Interlocks (Lean 4) to prevent catastrophic energy leakage into null-dimensions.
